        <h2>What is Arctic 80s?</h2>
        <p>Arctic 80s is a retro-themed website dedicated to the 1980s.</p>

        <h2>What is the 1980s?</h2>
        <p>The 1980s was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on January 1, 1980, and ended on December 31, 1989.</p>
        <p>The decade saw major socioeconomic change due to advances in technology and a worldwide move away from planned economies and towards laissez-faire capitalism.</p>
        <p>As economic deconstruction increased in the developed world, multiple multinational corporations associated with the manufacturing industry relocated into Thailand, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and China.</p>
        <p>Japan and West Germany saw large economic growth during this decade. The AIDS epidemic became recognized in the 1980s and has since killed an estimated 39 million people (as of 2013).</p>
        <p>Global warming became well known to the scientific and political community in the 1980s.</p>
        <p>After forming in the late 1970s, MTV would change the dynamics of television and music in the 1980s.</p>
        <p>This decade was also largely influenced by the growing influence of the personal computer, the cassette tape, and the CD.</p>
        <p>Important political leaders included U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, both of whom were elected in 1980.</p>
        <p>The 1980s saw great advances in genetic and digital technology.</p>
        <p>After years of animal experimentation since 1985 the first genetic modification of a whole organism, a mouse, by gene targeting was performed by Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies in 1989.</p>
        <p>The first digitally recorded optical disc CD was invented and released commercially in 1982.</p>
